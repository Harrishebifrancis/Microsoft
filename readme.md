ðŸŽ® Steam Marketplace Analytics

A focused analytics project that examines how price and genre relate to review quality and audience reach across Steam games. The goal is to surface publisher-ready insights (e.g., high-performing genres, trade-offs between free-to-play and paid, and quality vs. audience patterns) and present them in a compact, interactive dashboard.

What this project does

Ingests marketplace data for Steam titles (name, release date, price, genres, ratings, owners).

Derives core metrics used throughout the analysis:

review_total = positive_ratings + negative_ratings

review_score = positive_ratings / review_total (quality proxy, 0â€“1)

main_genre = first genre token (for clean grouping)

owners_num â‰ˆ numeric lower bound parsed from the owners range (audience proxy)

Analyzes relationships (no price-band bucketing):

Price â†” Review quality (overall and by genre)

Genre-level performance (quality, audience, typical price)

Differences between free-to-play and paid titles (if identifiable from price/metadata)

Presents insights visually in an interactive dashboard:

Filters: genre, price cap, minimum review volume (to avoid low-signal titles)

KPIs: games count, average price, average review score, median owners

Charts: Price vs Review Score; Top Genres by average quality

Sample Games table with configurable sorting (quality, review volume, owners, price ascending, newest first)

Examples of the insights itâ€™s built to reveal

Genres that pair high review quality with strong audience reach.

Overall priceâ€“quality relationship (often weak/negative) plus genre-specific exceptions.

Differences in audience and quality between free-to-play and paid titles.
