# ðŸŽ® Steam Marketplace Analytics

Insights on how **price** and **genre** relate to **review quality** and **audience reach** across Steam games. The project is designed to surface **publisher-ready findings** (e.g., high-performing genres, free-to-play vs paid trade-offs, and quality vs audience patterns) and present them in a compact, interactive dashboard.

## Overview

This project ingests a Steam marketplace dataset and computes a small set of derived metrics to analyze relationships between pricing, genres, and audience/quality proxies. The results are explored via an interactive dashboard that lets you filter, sort, and inspect representative titles.

**What it does**
- **Ingests marketplace data** for Steam titles (name, release date, price, genres, ratings, owners).
- **Derives core metrics** used throughout the analysis:
  - `review_total = positive_ratings + negative_ratings`
  - `review_score = positive_ratings / review_total` (quality proxy, 0â€“1)
  - `main_genre` = first genre token (for clean grouping)
  - `owners_num` â‰ˆ numeric lower bound parsed from the owners range (audience proxy)
- **Analyzes relationships** (no price-band bucketing):
  - Price â†” Review quality (overall and by genre)
  - Genre performance (quality, audience, typical price)
  - Differences between **free-to-play** and **paid** titles (when inferable from price/metadata)
- **Presents insights visually**:
  - **Filters:** genre, price cap, minimum total reviews (reduce noise)
  - **KPIs:** games count, average price, average review score, median owners
  - **Charts:** Price vs Review Score; Top Genres by average review score
  - **Sample Games table:** sortable by review quality, review volume, owners (approx), price (lowâ†’high), newest first
